# Datacamp-Classify-Song-Genres
Explore genre classification in music using machine learning! 
This GitHub repository presents a DataCamp project where you'll train a classifier to differentiate between Hip-Hop and Rock songs. Leverage Python's **_pandas_, _seaborn_**, and** _scikit-learn_ **libraries to analyze Echonest-derived track information. Implement key algorithms like **_PCA_, _logistic regression_,** and **_decision trees_** for accurate song genre prediction.
